<br>Seen people playing this strategy at Roulette and Black Jack tables ...  it rarely ends well.  Table bet limits, not enougn money, and even the "fairest" game at the Casino is not 50/50.  Casinos build massive flashy buildings, fill them full of gambling "fun", and have heaps of staff, and make huge profits ... because most people are going to lose in the end.

<br>Just written some Java code to run explore this further ...    and found that even if you apply this strategy every day for 100,000 days, the results are definitely NOT good.  On average you are going to lose all of your money within 92 hands and not get your bank balance higher than $137.
<br>**American Roulette 0, 00, 1-35  (100,000 trials)**
<br>* Hands to go Bankrupt:  Min: 7, Average: 82, Max: 524, Higest bank balance achieved: $130.00
<br>**European Roulette 0, 1-36  (100,000 trials)**
<br>* Hands to go Bankrupt:  Min: 7, Average: 92, Max: 455, Higest bank balance achieved: $137.00
<br>The Java code for this similation is available on my GitHub if anyone wants to explore this further.  :)
