Seen people playing this strategy at Roulette and Black Jack tables ...  it rarely ends well.  Table bet limits, not enougn money, and even the "fairest" game at the Casino is not 50/50.  Casinos build massive flashy buildings, fill them full of gambling "fun", and have heaps of staff, and make huge profits ... because most people are going to lose in the end.
